yeah little bit in js


[07/08/2022 9:38 AM] scaraven
Hi, I'm trying to get a general understanding of the protocol. Am I correct in that the `Vault` is responsible for holding the NFT's and that any action is facilitated by an external `Module` contract where each `Module` allows the `Vault` to perform a specific function (buying, selling, etc...)?

{Reactions}
catjam (2) 

[07/08/2022 11:51 AM] infosec_us_team
That's correct, as far as I understand the code. Modules are set by the curator upon fractionalization and can be adjusted via governance vote of token holders.


[07/08/2022 1:22 PM] 0x1f8b
Hello! what are the currently implemented plugins? just `NFTReceiver`? @snevins @swaHili

there currently are no implemented plugins, the `NFTReceiver` is simply used for testing purposes

Hi, a general question. After someone creates a vault, deposits his NFTs, and gets fraction tokens (ERC1155), how can he trade these fraction tokens?


[07/08/2022 8:55 PM] izhuer
I am curious about the underlying busness model, or is there any ERC1155-compatible Uniswap? 😂


[07/08/2022 8:57 PM] Franfran#5067
I think that it's the purpose of the Buyout contract


[07/08/2022 8:59 PM] izhuer
I guess the Buyout is for someone bidding for the NFTs, but i am a bit curious how these ERC1155 tokens are distributed at the very beginning


[07/08/2022 9:07 PM] pedr02b2
yea im still trying to work out what the first contract to interact with to be honest so i can try out testing some functions


[07/08/2022 9:08 PM] pedr02b2
im really fidning it hard to understan the archetecture of this one


[07/08/2022 9:08 PM] Franfran#5067
They are minted on vault deploying looks like


[07/08/2022 9:08 PM] Franfran#5067
in BaseVault.sol


[07/08/2022 9:08 PM] pedr02b2
yea i thought that so the vault holds all nfts fractional nfts etc


[07/08/2022 9:09 PM] pedr02b2
and then from the vault distrubted out


[07/08/2022 9:09 PM] pedr02b2
is that right


[07/08/2022 9:09 PM] pedr02b2
i think a little more infor ios needed on the project with regards to how everything works together


[07/08/2022 9:09 PM] Franfran#5067
true


[07/08/2022 9:10 PM] izhuer
Yes, all the `totalSupply` will be sent to the one who create the vault, e.g., Alice. But to earn profit, Alice should distribute those ERC1155 into the market.

{Reactions}
cyberheart 

[07/08/2022 9:10 PM] Franfran#5067
No I think that the fractions are directly sent to the owner wallet


[07/08/2022 9:10 PM] pedr02b2
as id like to try and create a few functions to see what i can do with regard to breaking the buy out proccess etc but i dont know where to start haha


[07/08/2022 9:10 PM] Franfran#5067
correct as my understanding


[07/08/2022 9:10 PM] izhuer
yes yes


[07/08/2022 9:11 PM] pedr02b2
right right ok thank you so much


[07/08/2022 9:11 PM] izhuer
then my question is, lol, how to distribute. It is more like a question about the business model which is not explicitly written in the contract.


[07/08/2022 9:11 PM] pedr02b2
yea 100%


[07/08/2022 9:12 PM] izhuer
just curious, Lol


[07/08/2022 9:12 PM] pedr02b2
but have to say im happy that i managed to work that out hahaha


[07/08/2022 9:12 PM] Franfran#5067
Isn't the Buyout contract a valid answer, sir ?


[07/08/2022 9:13 PM] snevins
Yeah, that's correct, so in this case Alice would choose the market/method to distribute the fractions, which is separate from the fractionalization/reconstitution of the underlying nfts


[07/08/2022 9:13 PM] izhuer
I suspect not? Bob cannot make a buyout, if he does not hold any ERC1155 tokens


[07/08/2022 9:13 PM] izhuer
before starting a buyout, Bob needs to get some ERC1155 tokens from Alice?


[07/08/2022 9:14 PM] izhuer
otherwise, it becomes a simple game where Alice holds all ERC1155 tokens


[07/08/2022 9:14 PM] Franfran#5067
Well yeah, Alice should put those tokens as an auction in the Buyout contract in order to distribute them isn't it ?


[07/08/2022 9:14 PM] Franfran#5067
Why not ?


[07/08/2022 9:14 PM] izhuer
i see your point


[07/08/2022 9:15 PM] izhuer
make sense


[07/08/2022 9:15 PM] pedr02b2
just reading th buy out while reading this seeing the pattern i thnk


[07/08/2022 9:15 PM] izhuer
Yes yes, it is my original understanding

💯 

[07/08/2022 9:16 PM] Franfran#5067
Nice hacking sirs then 🥸


[07/08/2022 9:17 PM] izhuer
do you have any example of how Alice choose market/method to distribute the fractions. I know it is out of the auditing scope, just wanna know how to distribute ERC1155 into the market 😂


[07/08/2022 9:17 PM] izhuer
please bear me if I bother a lot 😂, this question is not related to auditing tbh @snevins


[07/08/2022 9:18 PM] pedr02b2
no no your right cos i can see how you withdraw and NFT and batch withdraws but i dont see how you distribute them either


[07/08/2022 9:18 PM] pedr02b2
just how you withdraw them


[07/08/2022 9:18 PM] pedr02b2
create them create fractionals etc etc


[07/08/2022 9:19 PM] pedr02b2
permissions for the vault to make sure you can withdraw them etc i see all this


[07/08/2022 9:21 PM] izhuer
i think distributing fractions is not in the scope of their contracts, like Alice can directly transfer some fractions to Bob


[07/08/2022 9:21 PM] pedr02b2
yea i see the buy out is half or all of them


[07/08/2022 9:21 PM] pedr02b2
alice to bob


[07/08/2022 9:22 PM] izhuer
i am not sure whether buy out is designed for distributing fractions, tbh


[07/08/2022 9:22 PM] pedr02b2
na i mean you cant distribute fractions if you can only buy half or all of the supp[ly thats right


[07/08/2022 9:22 PM] pedr02b2
to distribute fractions you would need to able to distrubte one or all


[07/08/2022 9:23 PM] Franfran#5067
I don't think so, you can use `buyFractions` to buy an amount of fractions


[07/08/2022 9:23 PM] snevins
Yeah no worries, there are a lot of options to sell 1155s. opensea listings, sudoswap, 0x, or an auction mechanism on a custom contract for example


[07/08/2022 9:23 PM] pedr02b2
looking now


[07/08/2022 9:24 PM] izhuer
Lol, that is what I wanted! thanks a lot !!!

{Reactions}
catjam 

[07/08/2022 9:24 PM] izhuer
but to do so, assuming Alice want a price of P, she needs to put X tokens and (`TotalSupply` - X) * P ETH into the pool


[07/08/2022 9:25 PM] pedr02b2
@notice Buys fractional tokens in exchange for ether from a pool


[07/08/2022 9:25 PM] izhuer
it seems costy, which is not a good business model for users.


[07/08/2022 9:25 PM] pedr02b2
this right her eyou mean


[07/08/2022 9:25 PM] Franfran#5067
Why is that costy ?


[07/08/2022 9:26 PM] Franfran#5067
I see that as uniswap pairs where you have to put equal value of each tokens to balance the pairs


[07/08/2022 9:26 PM] izhuer
(TotalSupply - X) * P  would be a huge amount i think


[07/08/2022 9:26 PM] izhuer
yes yes, but Alice can put X tokens and X * P ETH


[07/08/2022 9:26 PM] Franfran#5067
Yes


[07/08/2022 9:26 PM] izhuer
instead of (TotalSupply - X) * P ETH


[07/08/2022 9:27 PM] Franfran#5067
yes I can't wrap my head around the calculation


[07/08/2022 9:27 PM] pedr02b2
was literally about to write that

[07/08/2022 9:27 PM] pedr02b2
these project have a way of making you feel really silly sometimes haha


[07/08/2022 9:28 PM] izhuer
lol, nvm, I think the sponsor gives us a perfect answer


[07/08/2022 9:31 PM] Franfran#5067
Btw, how is the buyout successful is more than 50% is still in the contract ?


[07/08/2022 9:37 PM] snevins
Yup that's correct!


[07/08/2022 9:37 PM] Franfran#5067
Yes but I would say that the buyout is successful if a lot of NFTs have been sold


[07/08/2022 9:37 PM] Franfran#5067
and it seems like it's not the case here


[07/08/2022 9:38 PM] snevins
The buyout is separate from the initial distribution of the fractions


[07/08/2022 9:43 PM] pedr02b2
is ok i think i might finally have it haha i need to write some code and have a play around with some functions i think to get a better understanding


[07/08/2022 9:44 PM] pedr02b2
this is a tough one to get the archetacture of though it has to be said 2 days so far trying to wrap my head around buy and distribute im glad i popped in now

can I DM you ?


[07/09/2022 10:08 AM] lovethewired
Trying to understand modules a bit better. I see modules and plugins are similar, however they are validated for delegatecall execution in the vault proxy a bit differently. Plugins don't have any state. And modules seem to make the basis for vaults? (not sure on this one). 
Can a vault have multiple modules? (though wouldn't storage collisions have to be accounted for?)


[07/09/2022 12:21 PM] 100proof
Targets and plugins are the things that are similar. And they should both be stateless to avoid delegatecall storage collisions

Don't get fooled by `address immutable registry` in Suppy.sol. This is fine because `immutable` is compiled away by Solidity

[07/09/2022 1:05 PM] tofunmi
If it doesn't,  i would Just write tests from scratch


[07/09/2022 1:05 PM] pedr02b2
it should pyut a blacksmith folder in your test folder


[07/09/2022 1:06 PM] pedr02b2
ive never worked with it before this is jyst what ive learnt over the last 2 days


[07/09/2022 1:07 PM] pedr02b2
im now trying to work out how to use them but there doesnt seem to be much info on blacksmith out there im more used to echidna and slither


[07/09/2022 1:09 PM] pedr02b2
it should leave you with 20 or 30 test contratcs ion the blacksmith folder as appose to the 5 or 10 thats in there in the OG repository


[07/09/2022 1:10 PM] tofunmi
Yh , not much info


[07/09/2022 1:11 PM] tofunmi
Is blacksmith integrated with foundry


[07/09/2022 1:12 PM] pedr02b2
i dont actaully know and im not 100% sure how exactly it works atym the only information that appears to be online is how to generate user contracts and thats it, no use case senarios, now how to use these contracts for testing etc nothing lol


[07/09/2022 1:13 PM] pedr02b2
but it did create for me infact 45 user contracts including mocks so im pretty thus far haha


[07/09/2022 1:14 PM] pedr02b2
impressed*


[07/09/2022 1:18 PM] tofunmi
Guess i would just delete the mocks before running it


[07/09/2022 1:19 PM] pedr02b2
yea what im going to do i think is send the out put to a text file and runa  few senarios with and with out and see if the out put differrs in some way


[07/09/2022 1:20 PM] tofunmi
It's very cool though


[07/09/2022 1:20 PM] pedr02b2
simple >> should do the trick and a few hundreds lines to read im sure hahaha


[07/09/2022 1:23 PM] 100proof
Did you run `make users`?


[07/09/2022 1:23 PM] tofunmi
Yh, not that much though,  but tricky


[07/09/2022 1:23 PM] 100proof

[07/09/2022 1:25 PM] pedr02b2
you are a legend it finally ran the bs.sol file thank you so much hahaha


[07/09/2022 1:27 PM] pedr02b2
now to get uit run the other blacksmith files not just the basevault.bs.sol


[07/09/2022 1:27 PM] 100proof
Yeah, that could have been explained better in the docs. I just noticed by accident that `make users` generated them.


[07/09/2022 1:28 PM] pedr02b2
ah hang on it ran a normal test file from the blacksmith file but not any of the blacksmith test .sol files


[07/09/2022 1:28 PM] pedr02b2
aahhhh


[07/09/2022 1:28 PM] 100proof

[07/09/2022 1:28 PM] pedr02b2

What command are you using to run tests?


[07/09/2022 1:29 PM] pedr02b2
forge test because thuse far ivew not found any command line commands for blacksmith


[07/09/2022 1:29 PM] pedr02b2
what did i miss


[07/09/2022 1:29 PM] 100proof
I'm just running `forge test`


[07/09/2022 1:29 PM] 100proof
I think that's it


[07/09/2022 1:30 PM] pedr02b2
and you have .bs.sol tests not just the .t.sol test


[07/09/2022 1:30 PM] 100proof
I think the BS files are just used as imports in `TestUtils.sol`


[07/09/2022 1:30 PM] 100proof

ive no idea there is no documentation anywhere about it accept how to install and the one case study they show on the github repo haha got to be the most poorly explained plugin ever hahaha


[07/09/2022 1:33 PM] 100proof
If you run `forge test` and everything comes back green then you've got the tests working.

make sure you always read the readme in full before trying to build manually - the sponsors provided the commands necessary to build everything and run the tests in a fresh environment, near the end of the file

there is a glossary at the bottom of the README that links to all the tools and libraries used throughout the repo. you will find a link to the Blacksmith github repo which explains how to use it. but in short, it’s used simply for testing purposes to generate user proxies

cyberheart thankyou 

[07/09/2022 4:40 PM] pedr02b2
yep 100% aware of that thanks and quitew frankly the write up for blacksmith is terrible as it had more than one of us scratching our heads  but thanks for the reply in any case

how does it change the output? I still don't get the table at the end with those changes


[07/10/2022 10:37 AM] 0xa5df
What command do you run? I ran `make report` or `forge test --gas-report -vvv --optimize` from the project-root and it does shows the full table after the change


[07/10/2022 10:39 AM] illilli000
oh ok, I ran `REPORT_GAS=true make test` - I'll try the commands you listed


[07/10/2022 10:41 AM] illilli000
confirmed that the old version doesn't output the table with `make report`, and the new version you've shown does- thanks!

Hi, when i run "make users" I get an error saying "couldn't read cache", have you had this? not sure what i'm missing


[07/10/2022 12:50 PM] illilli000
you're missing the commands that came before it (was able to reproduce) - check the bottom of the readme for the full list, and execute them in the order provided


[07/10/2022 12:54 PM] illilli000
Can you describe the modifications that were required?

flipping the file separators, and prefixing commands with `powershell.exe`, thanks!


[07/10/2022 4:18 PM] tofunmi
You have to run forge install first 
Delete the folder and re clone and run forge install


[07/10/2022 6:30 PM] illilli000
The instructions in the readme say to use `make deps`, create `.env` with the right contents, and run `npm ci` before doing `make users`. It's important that all steps from the readme be followed so that we don't waste the sponsor's time flagging non-issues

[09/07/2022 1:05 PM] rohan16
Approx it same for all contests


[09/07/2022 1:09 PM] Saintcode_#8823
So what's the difference between reporting one issue and a lot then?


[09/07/2022 1:12 PM] codingnamekiki
The difference is that the best structured and gas saving optimizations earn most of the prize pool.


[09/07/2022 1:18 PM] ak19966
If so.. do you say like gas is more priority than bugs.. !!!! I am surprised with this secnario...

why you only get 67 with a 85+?


[09/07/2022 3:51 PM] sm4rty_
maybe because of quality of reports. Not quantity
